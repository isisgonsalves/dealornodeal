PROJECT TITLE: Deal or No deal

My twist:
The name of the game is Deal or No Deal: trini edition.
I implemented Trinidadian slang/jargons to make it more interesting but that was not the actual twist.
The twist is in the function void gameOfodds () which is played in the last round of the game.
The banker feels sorry for the player and decides to give the player a chance to risk it or reap rewards. The player chooses odds between 1-10 or odds between 1-20. Based on their response, a random number is generated between 1 and the number chosen.
When the number is generated, if that number is less than half the value chosen + 1, the odds game will be “What are the odds you lose ½ your money in your lucky case right now?”
The player is required to choose a number carefully. If that number is 1 less, equal to or 1 higher than the randomly generated number, then the player loses half the money in their case and is deemed UNLUCKY.
When the number is more than half the value chosen + 1, the odds game will be “What are the odds you double your money in your lucky case right now?”
The player is required to choose a number carefully. If that number is 1 less, equal to or 1 higher than the randomly generated number, then the player gets double the money in their case and is deemed LUCKY.
I also included an outcome function, so based on the amount won, a “funny” phrase would be displayed.
I also made it more interactive by asking for the players name and how they planned on spending the money.
